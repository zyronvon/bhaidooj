                <p class="message-line">On this special day of Bhai Dooj, I want you to know how grateful I am for you.</p>
                <p class="message-line">You've been my anchor when things got rough, my mirror when I needed clarity, and my cheerleader when I doubted myself.</p>
                <p class="message-line">The bond we share isn't defined by tradition or obligation â€” it's built on genuine care, respect, and countless moments of connection.</p>
                <p class="message-line">You've taught me what it means to be patient, to listen deeply, and to show up for the people who matter.</p>
                <p class="message-line">I don't say it enough, but you make my life better just by being in it.</p>
                <p class="message-line">Thank you for being the sister I chose, and who chose me back.</p>
                <p class="message-line">This Bhai Dooj is as much about celebrating you as it is about celebrating us.</p>
                <p class="message-line">Here's to the laughs we've shared, the silences we've understood, and the bond that keeps growing stronger.</p>
                <p class="message-line signature-line">â€” Your Brother, Uday ðŸ’–</p>
